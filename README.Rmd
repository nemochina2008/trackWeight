# trackWeight

The goal of trackWeight is to help me keep track of my weight fluctuations over time
as I pursue weight loss via intermittent fasting. The package has a function
to create a range of date values and put `fasting` or `not fasting` depending
on the day to be added to a google sheet, and then another function that
reads in the filled out google sheet, and generates a figure that is below.

## Installation

You can install trackWeight from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rmflight/trackWeight")
```

## Track My Weight

```{r track_it, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(trackWeight)
weight_data <- read_sheet_data()
plot_weight(weight_data)
```
